*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include context and code examples in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
No. Blog functions as intended. I am able to view the posts, favorite the ones I like, then view my favorites in the 'faves' tab.

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
No, it was really straight forward. Though I would recommend automatically showing the posts on the homepage rather than just a `view my posts` link.

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
No. Code was well-written and easy to understand.

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
 No. The code used was on par with what has been discussed / shown in the course.

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
Not that I saw. Overall the code was very tidy and neat. Nothing seemed unnecessary.

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
Overall I think this is great work. From this project I can gather that this student clearly grasps the material taught in the course.
